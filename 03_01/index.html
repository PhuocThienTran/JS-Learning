    <h1>JS Objects Intro</h1>
    <p>
      Object: An object has many identifiable properties. However, between
      similar objects, they can share common properties, and this describes the
      prototype of an object. For example, a backpack can have different colors,
      sizes, and width (all unique identifiable properties), but between
      multiple backpacks, they have 2 straps, a flat back area, and an opening
      at the top (shared properties that describe the prototype of an object).
    </p>

    <p>
      Objects can have features built into them to change properties' values.
      For example, a backpack can be opened differently using a lid or a zipper
      (considered as features). In JavaScript, these features are methods
      (property-changing features inside objects). Methods only act upon the
      current object. For example, opening a backpack with a zipper doesn't
      change how another backpack is being opened with a button.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Objects can contain other objects. For example, a pen can be inside a
      backpack. In this case, the pen is seen as a property of the backpack
      object for as long as it's in there. The pen can have different sets of
      properties and methods and is a unique and separate object. It can be
      included inside another object or be separated. There can be one or many
      pens, and changing one does not change the others.
